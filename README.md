# üìö Competitive_Programming

Welcome to my **Competitive_Programming** repository!  
This repository contains my solutions to problems from several competitive programming platforms.  
Each folder corresponds to a different online judge, and all solutions are organized clearly for easy reference.

## üìÑ File Naming Convention

All solution files follow the format:

problemNumber___problemName.fileExtension

**Example:**  
`1071___Number_Spiral.cpp`

**Explanation:**

| Part                    | Description                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1071`                  | Problem number or ID from the online judge                       |
| `Number_Spiral`         | Problem name, underscores used for spaces                        |
| `.cpp`                  | File type / programming language (e.g., `.cpp`, `.c`, `.py`)     |

This format ensures files are **sorted numerically and are easy to identify** at a glance.

## üèÜ Online Judges 

### **CSES**
- The **CSES Problem Set** offers a curated list of competitive programming problems.  
- Focuses on **data structures, algorithms, and classical programming challenges**.  
- Widely used for learning and preparing for contests.

### **Codeforces**
- Popular competitive programming platform with **regular contests**.  
- Problems range from **easy to extremely challenging**, great for practicing time management and contest skills.

### **Beecrowd**
- Formerly known as URI Online Judge.  
- Large collection of problems, mostly algorithmic and computational.  
- Great for practicing **problem-solving and algorithmic thinking**.
*Note*: Some solutions to Beecrowd problems may be a bit unpolished, as they were my first attempts at coding. 

### **HackerRank**
- Online platform for learning and practicing **programming and algorithms**.  
- Problems often come with **detailed test cases** and **tutorials**, making it beginner-friendly.
