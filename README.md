# 📚 Competitive_Programming

Welcome to my **Competitive_Programming** repository!  
This repository contains my solutions to problems from several competitive programming platforms.  
Each folder corresponds to a different online judge, and all solutions are organized clearly for easy reference.

## 📄 File Naming Convention

All solution files follow the format:

problemNumber___problemName.fileExtension

**Example:**  
`1071___Number_Spiral.cpp`

**Explanation:**

| Part                    | Description                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1071`                  | Problem number or ID from the online judge                       |
| `Number_Spiral`         | Problem name, underscores used for spaces                        |
| `.cpp`                  | File type / programming language (e.g., `.cpp`, `.c`, `.py`)     |

This format ensures files are **sorted numerically and are easy to identify** at a glance.
